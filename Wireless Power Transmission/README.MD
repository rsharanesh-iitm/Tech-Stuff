# Wireless Charging ---> Wireless Power transmission
In the recent times, we see a wholelot of smartphones coming up with wireless charging facilities. The first phones/tablets with wireless charging features came around in the year 2010. But it took around 4-5 years for it to gain a bit of popularity. Even today after a decade, this isn't much popular in all the mobile phones. Mostly, it's available in the high-end phones. The reason behind this is it's high cost and low efficiency (performance/cost ratio). 

***But anyways how does this work?***

Inductive charging was first invented by Nikola Tesla, and it was in use during 1990's in the tooth brushes. The main underlying principle of wireless charging is the inductive charging (a.k.a wireless charging/cordless charging) which is purely based on Faraday's law of induction. Energy is transferred through inductive coupling. An electrical charge passes safely from the pad to the phone, across the tiny gap between them. The charging pad still needs to be plugged into the mains electrical supply, but the device we tend to charge sits loosely on top. Also, a note on it is that wireless charging doesn't mean that there aren't wires at all, ther's no cable between the device and the power socket. However, the charging pad must be connected to the power socket so that there is AC current source that is used in the coil for induction.

***Inductive charging***

Here, the principle of energy transfer is inductive coupling. And hence both the charging pad and phone contain induction coils in them. In simple terms, induction coils are simply a core of iron wrapped in copper wire. An alternating current is run through an induction coil in the charging station or source pad (the primary or transmission coil.) Any moving electric charge creates a magnetic field, as stated by Oersted's law. The magnetic field fluctuates in strength as the AC current is continually changing amplitude. A changing magnetic field generates an electromotive force otherwise known as Faraday's law of induction. This makes an alternating electric current in a second induction coil (the receiving, or secondary coil) in the portable device. It is then converted to direct current with a rectifier and used to charge a battery or provide operating power.

To summarize it, when the phone or other portable device is placed on the wireless charging pad, the proximity of the coils allows an electromagnetic field to be created. This electromagnetic field allows electricity to be passed from one coil (in the charging pad) to the other (in the phone). The induction coil in the phone then uses the transferred electricity to charge the device battery.

***Advantges***

The following is a best example of a company that serves the need in a wider scale.
## WiTricity = Wireless + Electricity

The company aims at providing solutions to charging problems in terms of wireless charging facilities. At present, it's only available for Electric vehicles, but it also aims at developing it further for all electrical home appliances that are used.

***WiTricity uses resonant inductive coupling technology principle for power transfer.***

Their idea of implementing the same to all the homes is by using Source resonating coils that will be placed in the walls of the home.
