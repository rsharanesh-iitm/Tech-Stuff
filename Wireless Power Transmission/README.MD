# Wireless Charging ---> Wireless Power transmission
In the recent times, we see a wholelot of smartphones come up with wireless charging facilities. The first phones/tablets with wireless charging features came around in the year 2010. But it took around 4-5 years for it to gain a bit of popularity. vn today after a decade, this isn't much popular in all the mobile phones. Mostly, it's available in the high-end phones. The reason behind this is it's high cost and low efficiency (performance/cost ratio). 

***But anyways how does this work?***
The main underlying principle of wireless charging is the induction charging which is purely based on Faraday's law ofinduction. Energy is transferred through inductive coupling. An alternating current is run through an induction coil in the charging station or source pad (the primary or transmission coil.) Any moving electric charge creates a magnetic field, as stated by Oersted's law. The magnetic field fluctuates in strength as the AC current is continually changing amplitude. A changing magnetic field generates an electromotive force otherwise known as Faraday's law of induction. This makes an alternating electric current in a second induction coil (the receiving, or secondary coil) in the portable device. It is then converted to direct current with a rectifier and used to charge a battery or provide operating power.

The following is a best example of a company that serves the need in a wider scale.
## WiTricity = Wireless + Electricity

The company aims at providing solutions to charging problems in terms of wireless charging facilities. At present, it's only available for Electric vehicles, but it also aims at developing it further for all electrical home appliances that are used.

***WiTricity uses resonant inductive coupling technology principle for power transfer.***

Their idea of implementing the same to all the homes is by using Source resonating coils that will be placed in the walls of the home.
