## Android vs iOs (A comparison in view of their processor)

There are two main types of smartphone devices available currently in the market. They are the Android and the iOs phones. Even though both do perform similar kind of features, there quite a few important differences in thier working, and the way they are manufactured. 

***One such important difference in between lies in the processor of each kind. Processor is the heart of the smartphone that performs all the required functionality. In this approach let's find out more on what's the differene between the processor in android phones and the processors in the iPhones.***

***How are iOs procesors made?***
Apple designs processors that use ARM’s 64-bit instruction architecture. That means that Apple’s chips use the same underlying RISC architecture as Qualcomm, Samsung, Huawei and others. The difference is that Apple holds an architectural license with ARM, which allows it to design its own chips from scratch. Apple’s first in-house 64-bit ARM processor was the Apple A7 which was used in the iPhone 5S. It had a dual-core CPU, clocked at 1.4 GHz and a quad-core PowerVR G6430 GPU.
