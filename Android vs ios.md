## Android vs iOs (A comparison in view of their processor)

There are two main types of smartphone devices available currently in the market. They are the Android and the iOs phones. Even though both do perform similar kind of features, there quite a few important differences in thier working, and the way they are manufactured. 

***One such important difference in between lies in the processor of each kind. Processor is the heart of the smartphone that performs all the required functionality. In this approach let's find out more on what's the differene between the processor in android phones and the processors in the iPhones.***


***Apple's own designed Processors***
Apple has designed System on Chip (SoC) and System in Package (SiP) processors for their mobile consumer devices. They combine a low-power central processing unit (CPU) and other components into a physically compact package to meet the stringent power and space constraints common to mobile devices.

In the earlier stages, Apple first used SoCs in early revisions of the iPhone and iPod touch. These were specified by Apple and manufactured by Samsung, they combine in one package a single ARM-based processing core (CPU), a graphics processing unit (GPU), and other electronics necessary for mobile computing.

***How are iOs procesors made?***
Apple designs processors that use ARM’s 64-bit instruction architecture. That means that Apple’s chips use the same underlying RISC architecture as Qualcomm, Samsung, Huawei and others. The difference is that Apple holds an architectural license with ARM, which allows it to design its own chips from scratch. Apple’s first in-house 64-bit ARM processor was the Apple A7 which was used in the iPhone 5S. It had a dual-core CPU, clocked at 1.4 GHz and a quad-core PowerVR G6430 GPU.

***Apple outraged all processors all of a sudden***
It is fair to say that Apple caught Qualcomm sleeping when it announced the 64-bit A7 back in 2013. Until that point, Apple and Qualcomm had both been shipping 32-bit ARMv7 processors for use in mobile devices. Qualcomm was leading the field with its 32-bit Snapdragon 800 SoC. It used an in-house Krait 400 core along with the Adreno 330 GPU. Life was good for Qualcomm.

When Apple suddenly announced a 64-bit ARMv8 CP, Qualcomm had nothing. But it didn't much time for qualcomm to design a 64 bit processor. In April 2014, Qualcomm launched the Snapdragon 810 with four Cortex-A57 cores and four Cortex-A53 cores. The “Cortex” range of cores come directly from ARM, the custodians of the ARM architecture. But in that same year, Apple announced the A8, its second generation in-house 64-bit CPU. It wasn’t until March 2015 that Qualcomm was able to announce its first generation in-house 64-bit CPU, the Snapdragon 820, with its custom Kryo CPU core.
