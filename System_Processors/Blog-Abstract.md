### Introduction
This section will cover the overview on what are smartphones and their working. It covers up the brief on their applications and uses. It will also include the overview of the feaures of a smartphone.

### Processors
In this section, we will be discussing about the processors that are the heart of any electronic gadget. It will include the working of the processors, their functionalities and their stucture, flowhart and the components it's made of. Also, we will be covering the major differences between a mobile phone processor and a computer processor.

### Mobile Phone Processors
This section concentrates mainly on the internal architecture and the components of the mobile phone. This includes the SoC and the processor and the other hardware components that supports the mobile's procssor. There will be few images related to the internal structure of the processors.

### Android vs iOS 
This is the main topic of debate, where we discuss on the main two types of Mobile phone processors that are currently available, namely the Android and the iOS kind. Though these are just Operating system that run on these processor, there are subtle differences in them with regards to thier internal designing. The comparison on both these will be made on all the aspects of the procssor. It will also include the reasons for such difference and why isn't the best way followed by other.
