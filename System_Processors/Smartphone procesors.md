## Smartphone processors
***Introduction***

The phone processor mainly depends on the framework. The power consumption depends on the process that the smartphone processor is built on. Performance to a large extent depends on the CPUâ€™s main frequency and core number. Image performance (game performance) depends on the GPU. Besides, the network mode depends on the baseband. In a word, the processor is the most important and one of the most expensive hardware for a phone.

At present, the Apple A13, the Huawei Kirin 990, the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865,  and the Samsung Exynos 9820 belong to the best smartphone processors. These five top processors are built on the currently most advancing 7nm manufacturing process and have good control on power consumption.

Now, let's have a look at all the various factors that must be taken into account before deciding on the processor:

***Brand of the Processor:***

You might not find this to be very important, but trust me, it is. There are many brands that are producing processors these days however, not every brand offers the best. Therefore, it is important to know what you want, and which processor can provide you that with. Few of the big names in the chipset industry are MediaTek, Snapdragon, Exynos, Kirin etc. Earlier, brands like Snapdragon has an unbeaten monopoly over the market, however all of that changed with the inception of MediaTek.

MediaTek made a name and place for itself in no time. And as of now, MediaTek produces extremely powerful processors for not only budget segment but also the mid-range and the flagships.

***Number of Cores:***

Most of the chipsets that are available presently are octa-core and a tip here, always go for a chipset that at least has 8 cores. This would ensure a faster performance of your smartphone along with zero lag and glitches. Performance being one of the major aspects of a smartphone, it is also important to check for the clock speed. Minimum of 2GHz is what one should go for.

***Size of the Processor:***

If you go on to compare the processors that were made a few years ago and the one that are made now, the one thing that would be evident is that the sizes of the chipsets have reduced considerably. This is because a smaller chipset compared to a chipset that is bigger in size would consume less power, therefore longer battery life of your smartphone, with better performance and last but not the least, it would also optimize your smartphone display better.

***Conclusion***

All the above mentioned are few simple yet extremely important things one should keep in mind while choosing a device for themselves. Few things about the processor, that guarantees amazing user experience owing to better performance, long battery life, and so on and so forth.
